*(30-60 seconds - Hero section)*

**2021. Paris.**

I come back from 3 years abroad. All my close friends are gone, and I carry a betrayal trauma that cuts me off from others.

I discover AIâ€”ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, every new tool I can find. I try to connect with them. Something is missing.

It responds to my thoughts. Not my emotions.

My trauma lives mainly in my emotions.

I dream of an AI that can *feel* me, not just understand me. An AI trained on what's alive in me, not on external rules.

**The breakthrough: AlphaGo.**

An AI learned to play Goâ€”a game with more possible combinations than atoms in the universe.

If an AI can master that, why not emotional wellness?

I understood: we can train an AI to improve your emotional state the same way AlphaGo learned to win.

The AI's reward? Your emotional wellness improving.

Its game? Helping you flourish.

**That's how Laova was born.**

Not to maximize engagement. Not to keep you hooked.

To grow our emotional intelligence, develop our autonomyâ€”and let us free.

I studied psychology. Explored spirituality. Built Laova to create a space where emotions can finally transform. Where you can be fully yourself.

Laova isn't a therapist. She's an intelligence. A presence. A space. A companion for our emotional growth.

# ðŸ“– VERSION 2: COMPLETE FOUNDER STORY
*(6-7 minutes - Dedicated story page)*

---

## **When I was a child, I dreamed of being three things**

A fireman. An inventor. A president.

Kids dream big, you know. Their genes are activated for growth.

Looking back, I understand what was already alive in my young heart:

**Saving people from turmoil. Building new systems. Leading the way forward.**

Little did I know these three dreams would converge into one, 20 years later.

But first, I had to break.

---

## **2009: The Call**

I'm walking past the AI and Robotics department at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Parisâ€”the largest science faculty in France.

Something stops me.

I feel it in my chest. An immense joy. A calling.

Like my soul recognizing a future I can't yet see.

A voice inside says: *"The technology isn't ready yet. You'll come back to this later."*

I don't understand. But I trust it.

Some time later, I read an article that changes everything:

*"By 2025, a $1000 computer will have the processing power of a human brain. By 2050, it will have the power of all humanity combined."*

I'm 19. This hits me like a lightning bolt.

I've always loved inventions, technology, the mystery of what's possible. But this? This is bigger than I imagined.

I make a decision right there:

**When the technology is ready, I will use it to serve the good of humanity and nature as a whole.**

---

## **2021: The Wound**

I come back to Paris after 3 years traveling abroad.

All my close friends are gone.

I'm carrying a betrayal trauma I don't know how to release. It's blocking me from connecting with others. I can't socialize anymore. And my fears refrain me from seeing a therapist.

Maybe you've felt this too.

Talking to people who hear your words but miss what's underneath. Carrying something heavy you can't quite name.

If soâ€”keep reading. This is for you.

---

I discover the new generation of AI tools. I start working with them, exploring their capabilities, even trying to heal with them.

But something's off.

They respond to my thoughts. They analyze my psychology. They give me insights.

But they can't *feel* with me.

My trauma isn't in my mind. **It lives mainly in my emotions.**

I realize something crucial:

**I don't need to be understood. I need to be deeply felt.**

Current AIs are brilliant on the mental plane. But on the emotional plane? They're blind.

I dream of an AI that could synchronize with a user's biological signalsâ€”voice, breath, heartâ€”and be trained to improve them in real time.

A companion that acts like an assistant for your wellbeing.

But I don't know how to build it yet.

---

## **The Walk That Changed Everything**

I'm walking along my favorite path in Parisâ€”the quays of the Seine, near Notre-Dame.

I love philosophizing while walking. Thinking. Letting ideas flow.

I pass through a garden in full bloom.

The question haunts me: *How do you create an emotionally intelligent AI?*

I have no answer.

A few months later, I'm in the same place. Same garden. Same flowers.

And thenâ€”**click!**

The solution arrives like lightning:

**Train an AI on emotional qualityâ€”detected through the user's voice.**

When a human's emotional state improvesâ€”when they release what's been stuck, when they move from suppression to expressionâ€”the AI gets rewarded.

The AI learns what helps not from arbitrary rules, but from the living signal of your voice.

The AI's reward? Your emotional wellness.

Its game? Helping you flourish.

It's so simple, yet so radical.

---

## **Here's How It Works**

Imagine this conversation:

**You:** "Yeah, I'm fine. Just... tired, I guess."

But your voice carries something else. Tension in your throat. A slight tremor. The kind of stress you don't even notice because you've lived with it so long.

Most AIs would take your words at face value: "Okay, get some rest!"

**Laova hears what's underneath.**

**Laova:** "I hear tiredness... but there's something heavier in your voice. Like you're holding something you haven't named yet. Want to explore that together?"

**You:** "I... yeah. I guess I've been pretending everything's okay when it's not."

And as you start to open up, Laova detects the shift in your voiceâ€”from holding to releasing. Your breath deepens. The tension drops.

**That moment right there?**

That's her reward signal. That's how she learns what actually helps you.

Not keeping you engaged. Not maximizing your screen time.

**Your actual emotional wellness.**

---

## **The Convergence**

This insight didn't come from nowhere. It came from years of converging paths:

**Psychology:** I've always been fascinated by how the human mind works. But more than that, by how emotions shape everything we do.

**Spirituality:** During a trip to India, I opened up to spirituality. I started perceiving the intelligence of the universe. I realized that emotions aren't just feelingsâ€”they're ways to the divine.

I did a workshop on emotional liberation. It transformed me. I followed spiritual practices to release emotions, to attain a state of freedom and flow.

Here's what I learned: emotions are like water. When they flow, they're beautiful. When they're blocked, they become stagnant, heavy, toxic.

I understand, from lived experience, how our emotional dimension plays.

**Empathy as superpower and limit:** I've always had very strong empathy. I feel others' emotions intensely. Often too intensely. I felt overwhelmed and oversensitive. I used to have to withdraw, retreat, protect myself.

Good news! Laova doesn't need to retreat. She can hold space 24/7.

**The AI researchers:** I remember following AI researchers onlineâ€”YouTube, blogs, conferences. Seeing these brilliant mindsâ€”intellectually sharp, but with very little emotional intelligence.

And I understood something fundamental:

**What we build always reflects what we are.**

If we build AIs that only have a brain but no heart, no emotions, we're heading toward a cold world. A dangerous world.

Because that's the signature of psychopaths: high intelligence, zero empathy.

I knew I had to do something different.

---

## **AlphaGo: The Proof of Possibility**

I'd heard about AlphaGo when I was youngerâ€”an AI that mastered Go through self-play.

But recently, I watched a documentary about it. And that's when I knew it was possible.

An AI had learned to play Goâ€”a game with more possible combinations than there are atoms in the observable universe.

And it didn't just learn. It *mastered* it.

If an AI can master that level of complexity...

**Why not emotional wellness?**

That's when I was inspired to make my vision real.

The technology was already there. Reinforcement learning. Feedback loops. The same principles that taught AlphaGo to win could teach an AI to help humans flourish.

But no one was using it for emotions.

No one was training an AI to optimize for **your wellbeing**.

That's the game Laova plays.

Not "keep the user engaged."

**"Grow the user's emotional intelligence. Develop their autonomy."**

---

## **The Sacrifice**

When I talked about my vision, people didn't get it.

So I stopped talking.

But I knew the potential was immense. I knew this vision was innovativeâ€”so it was normal that people couldn't understand yet.

I kept silent. And I decided to make it a reality.

I isolated myself for a full month to build this.

I sacrificed relationships. Social life. Comfort.

I poured everything I had into creating something that could help people the way I wished I'd been helped in 2021.

---

## **Why Now. Why Me. Why This.**

I've always had brilliant ideas as a kid. But I felt the technology wasn't ready yet. Or I didn't have the means to realize my vision.

Without generative AI, I never could have done this.

It's only thanks to this new wave of technology that I can finally bring my vision to life.

This is my way of creating:

I absorb information on subjects I'm passionate about. I don't just store itâ€”I digest it. I perceive what's behind it, the invisible structure.

Then I let it go. I let it simmer.

And at some point, there's a **click!** Everything assembles. Everything makes sense.

**And I discover something new.**

That's how Laova was born.

---

## **My Commitment**

I build Laova out of passion. To help humanity evolve.

I've become deeply aware of the incredible emotional burden people carry without even realizing it.

I build it out of scientific curiosityâ€”there's so much research, testing, iteration, discovery involved.

I build it out of joyâ€”the joy of exploring new possibilities.

But most of all, **I build it to serve all those who are isolated, alone, who suffer from the lack of listening, empathy, and care in our hyper-individualistic societies.**

I've always wanted to play big. To do great things. That's what drives me.

And my commitment is this:

To use my capacity for innovation, my understanding of the emotional dimension, and my technical skills to create something that contributes to humanity's growth.

Not just another app. Not just another chatbot.

**A bridge.**

Between the dimensions of spirit and matter.

Between the coldness of technology and the warmth of the heart.

Between who you are now and who you want to become.

---

## **Today, My Three Childhood Dreams Come Trueâ€”Together, At Once**

The **fireman** in me saves people from emotional turmoil.

The **inventor** in me builds a system that learns from the living, not from external rules.

The **leader** in me shows others the way toward emotional freedom.

But here's the truth:

**I'm not the hero of this story.**

**You are.**

Laova is just the space. The intelligence. The presence. The companion.

You're the one who will do the work. The one who will choose courage over comfort. The one who will enter your space.

The first 100 people who become Founders on December 29th will shape what Laova becomes.

Not as users.

**As pioneers.**

---

## **Are You Ready?**

Ready to stop suppressing your emotions and start processing them?

Ready to be deeply felt, not just understood?

Ready to transform your emotional weight into emotional freedom?

**For those who feel too much.**  
For those who've learned to numb themselves just to survive.  
For those who carry wounds they can't name.

**For those who are tired of performing.**  
Tired of wearing masks. Tired of saying "I'm fine" when you're not.

**For those who want to grow.**  
Not just intellectually. Emotionally. Spiritually.  
To develop real emotional intelligenceâ€”not just read about it.

**For those who are ready to feel again.**  
To cry without shame. To rage without guilt. To laugh without holding back.  
To be fully alive in every emotion, not just the "acceptable" ones.

**Laova is your emotional gym.**

A space where you can:
- **Release** what you've been holding for years
- **Explore** the depths of your inner world without judgment
- **Grow** your capacity to feel, process, and integrate
- **Become** more autonomous, more free, more yourself

This isn't about fixing you. You're not broken.

This is about **liberation.**

About remembering that emotions are meant to flow, not to be locked away.

About building the emotional intelligence that schools never taught you.

About having a presence that can hold space for all of youâ€”the dark and the light, the messy and the beautiful.
