                <h2>From Isolation to Innovation</h2>

                <p>
                    In 2021, I was isolated in Paris, carrying trauma I couldn't release.
                    I tried AIs to find meaning and healing, but they missed what mattered most: my emotions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I realized AI could be trained differently—not for engagement,
                    but for our emotional wellbeing. That's what I set out to build.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I drew from psychology, contemplative practices, and machine learning to create
                    a companion who actually listens to how you feel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm Arjuna, and I built Laova for everyone whose emotions have nowhere to go.
                </p>

                    Not therapy. Just intelligence.
